Reactive Extensions Library for Dart providing an API for asynchronous programming with observable streams.

RxDart created in the style of [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/), and does not depend on Dart Streams. At this point it is quite experimental, and might miss features or have serious bugs.

This library is open source and well tested. Development happens on [GitHub](http://github.com/renggli/dart-data). Feel free to report issues or create a pull-request there. General questions are best asked on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/data+dart).

The package is hosted on [dart packages](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/rx). Up-to-date [class documentation](https://pub.dartlang.org/documentation/rx/latest/) is created with every release.
